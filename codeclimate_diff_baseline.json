Therefore there must be something which 'knows' about the contents or purposes of the arguments.  That thing would have to be more than just a basic type, because the basic types are either containers which don't know about their contents, or they are single objects which can't capture their relationship with their fellows of the same type. So, this thing with the extra knowledge should be reified into a class, and the utility method will most likely belong there.\n\n## Example\n\nRunning Reek on:\n\n```Ruby\nclass Warehouse\n  def sale_price(item)\n    (item.price - item.rebate) * @vat\n  end\nend\n```\n\nwould report:\n\n```Bash\nWarehouse#total_price refers to item more than self (FeatureEnvy)\n```\n\nsince this:\n\n```Ruby\n(item.price - item.rebate)\n```\n\nbelongs to the Item class, not the Warehouse.\n"},"severity":"minor"},
